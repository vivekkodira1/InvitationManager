InvitationManager
=================

A HTML + JavaScript application to manage invitations.

A simple application that allows users to add invitees, dependents and metadata about invitees and stores the data as a JSON.

Displays a table-like view, a summary and also allows users to save/import from the raw JSON

Planning to add:
1. Search
2. Undo/Redo
3. Processing invites logic (allow users to iterate through invites of a certain location/mode)
4. Import/Export to csv
5. Improve quality to use templating (and remove structure coded in JS)
6. Tests
